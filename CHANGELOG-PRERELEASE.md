- Automatic Replace EndBone With Endpoint Position [`#1423`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1423)
  - Trace and Optimize now automatically replaces PhysBone's EndBone with Endpoint Position if possible.

### Changed
- Useful error message will be shown when known unity bug that prevents you from building your avatar [`#1563`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1563)
  - Actually I cannot reproduce the bug so I hope this works but nothing certify this works.

### Fixed
- Cubemap textures are removed unexpectedly [`#1566`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1566)
- Unexpectedly textures with uv transforms are atlased [`#1569`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1569)

- Linear Entry-Exit support for Entry-Exit to 1D BlendTree Optimization [`#1498`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1498) [`#1506`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1506)
  - Since this version, Entry => State1 => State2 => Exit pattern is now supported.
- More cases are supported by Automatically Freeze BlendShape [`#1510`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1510)
    - AAO can now freeze BlendShapes that are animated in animator layers with weights between 0 and 1.
- Remove unused textures in Remove Unused Objects `1502`
- Invert option of Remove Mesh by BlendShape [`#1535`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1535)

  - External tools can now programmatically add and configure RemoveMeshByMask components.
- Complete Graph to Entry Exit optimization [`#1544`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1544)
    - New optimization in the Animator Optimizer, which is part of Trace and Optimize.
    - It's expected that this optimization will reduce the number of transitions computed every frame.
    - After this optimization, Entry Exit to BlendTree optimization may be applied.
- Minimum linting for some mistakes that reduces the avatar performance [`#1549`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1549)
  - AAO now performs basic linting to identify common mistakes that can negatively impact avatar performance.
  - Currently, multi-pass rendering with exactly the same material is detected since it's likely a mistake that clicks '+' button on the inspector by mistake.
- Max Texture Size component to limit texture [`#1516`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1516)
- Merge Material component which is successor of Merge ToonLit Material [`#1516`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1516)
  - This component merges multiple materials into one material.
  - This component supports many shader includes lilToon, ToonStandard and others.
  - Merge ToonLit Material is now deprecated. Please use this new component instead.
  - Merge ToonLit Material will be removed in next major version.
  - This component will support both Skinned Mesh Renderer and Mesh Renderer.

### Changed
- Avatar Optimizer will run as late as possible in NDMF Pipeline by default [`#1493`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1493)
  - To achieve this, I changed the name of plugin class, which is internal API, to contain non-ASCII character (with escape sequence).
  - It's not recommended but when you actually want to run after Avatar Optimizer, you can use [`AfterPlugin`] api with `"com.anatawa12.avatar-optimizer"` as the plugin name in NDMF.
    - In such cases, it might be necessary to register your components to Avatar Optimizer with API. For more details about registering components, see [Make your components compatible with Avatar Optimizer] in the documentation.
  - This changes order of default plugin order, but when your plugin depending on running Avatar Optimizer after your plugin, it's better to use [`BeforePlugin`] api with `"com.anatawa12.avatar-optimizer"` as the plugin name in NDMF.
- Moved removing submeshes with no materials assigned to the early process of AAO [`#1495`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1495)
  - This should let other process like freezing blendshapes ignore such submeshes.
- Replace Mask Texture Editor ['#1470'](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1470)
- Ignore unknown IEditorOnly components and log a warning in console instead of showing a popup. ['#1422'](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1422)
- Orphan Vertices will be kept [`#1515`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1515)
    - Vertices that are not part of any triangle will be kept.
    - Orphan vertices are likely to be used to control the bounds of the mesh so they will be kept.
- Allow Shuffle Material Slots is now enabled by default [`#1533`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1533)
- Descriptive localized messages are shown in Play Mode when animation keys are removed [`#1461`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1461)
  - When AAO removes animation keys because target objects are absent, descriptive messages in the user's language are now shown in Play Mode to help understand what happened.
  - These messages explain that the target object is absent, keys were removed by AAO, and suggest reporting if this is incorrect.
  - In Edit Mode (upload builds), the behavior remains unchanged with a terse internal identifier to minimize avatar size.
- VRChat parameter drivers now work correctly when parameters are converted from bool/int to float during Entry-Exit to BlendTree optimization [`#1547`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1547)
  - Based on fix from NDMF (bdunderscore/ndmf#693)
  - Parameter drivers now use intermediate parameters to preserve original type semantics
- Motion time state is now supported in EntryExit to BlendTree optimization [`#1552`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1552)
  - Motion time state is safe to convert to BlendTree since it does not affect parameter evaluation.
  - This change may increase the number of states converted to BlendTree.
- Greater / Less and Float conditions support for Entry-Exit to BlendTree optimization [`#1554`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1554)
  - Equals / NotEquals conditions for Ints or Bool operators are only supported in previous versions of Animator Optimizer.
  - Please note that creating animator controllers that can optimized with this optimization is difficult with Float operators because we need to use BitIncrement/Decrement-ed condition threshold for exiting parameters.
  - For example, when we use `> 0` condition for entry transition, we need to use `< 1e-45 (BitIncrement(0))`, which is equivalent to `<= 0`, for exit transition.
- Streaming mipmap settings are copied when processing textures [`#1558`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1558)

### Fixed
- Merging SubMeshes may not work for some meshes [`#1501`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1501)
- EnsureRunningOnMainThread can only be called from the main thread error in some cases [`#1503`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1503)
- Error from optimize texture when remove unused objects is disabled [`#1504`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1504)
- Unity error when SkinnedMesh has no blend shapes after optimization [`#1402`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1402)
- Mesh can be disappeared when BlendShapes with infinity in their delta are frozen with AAO [`#1518`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1518)
    - Freezing them would result Infinity in vertex position, which results NaN or Infinity in bounds, which makes Unity to clear the mesh.
- VRM: A NullReferenceException or MissingReferenceException may occur when parsing incomplete VRM components [`#1524`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1524)
- MeshCompression settings is not preserved after AvatarOptimizer process [`#1529`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1529)
  - This bug increases size of some avatars unexpectedly. This is fixed now.
- Missing `Ignore Other Phys Bone` support for Merge Phys Bone [`#1532`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1532)
  - Ignore Other Phys Bone property is not supported by Merge Phys Bone. This was a bug.
  - This version fixes this bug.
- Fixed Optimize Texture may throw error in rare cases [`#1538`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1538)
- Basic mesh support for remove mesh components [`#1530`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1530)
  - You now can remove some portion of basic meshes with Remove Mesh components!
  - This does not includes remove mesh by blendshape because basic mesh does not support blendshape.

## [1.8.14] - 2025-10-04

### Fixed
- AAO may break infinimation [`#1492`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1492)
    - The infinimation is the technique of animation that may be used in NDMF or other tools.
    - I hope most of AAO users don't experience this issue for now, but will be spread in the near future.

  - No beta sdk for 3.8.0 (it was 3.7.x) so this is not possible before stable release.

## [1.8.8-beta.2] - 2025-04-02
## [1.8.8-beta.1] - 2025-03-24
### Fixed
- Particle Systems referencing Skinned Mesh Renderers without material slots will be broken [`#1426`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1426)
  - AAO's removing unused submeshes feature will remove all submeshes if there are no material slots.
  - However, Unity's Particle System does't require materials slots are present so AAO broke this relatively rare case.
- Optimize Texture is not applied in some cases [`#1427`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1427)

## [1.8.7] - 2025-03-01

### Changed
- Removed missing viseme / eyelids warning [`#1401`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1401)
- Improved Optimize Texture a little [`#1404`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1404)
  - This should reduce texture memory usage a little and fixes a bug that may increase texture usage.

## [1.8.7-beta.1] - 2025-02-16
### Fixed
- Animations targets GameObjects includes '/' in their name can be broken [`#1399`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1399)

## [1.8.6] - 2025-02-14
## [1.8.6-beta.1] - 2025-02-11

- VRM: Fix Trace and Optimize incorrectly merging Skinned Meshes with different FirstPerson settings  [`#1376`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1376)

## [1.8.3] - 2024-12-24
## [1.8.3-beta.1] - 2024-12-24
### Fixed
- Prefab overrides on the scene are reverted on first load of the scene at first launch [`#1372`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1372)
- Animating transform with C# named properties are broken by merge bone [`#1373`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1373)
  - Animator window won't create such animation but some script generates and it works surprisingly
- Errors with blendShapes with exactly same name in a mesh [`#1374`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1374)
  - Such mesh can be generated with Autodesk Maya or 3ds Max
  - Unity API denies generating such mesh with C# so AAO will rename such blendShapes to unique name to support.
  - Unity Animator does animate first blendshale only so second shape would generally removed by remove unused blendShapes.

## [1.8.2] - 2024-12-11
### Added
- `-` button for prefab safe set [`#1368`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1368)

### Changed
- Make error for MergeBone with MergePB rotation mode fix [`#1345`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1345)
  - This was not working as expected in previous version so I made this error.
  - We may add support or change behavior in the future release

### Fixed
- Error with nested merge skinned mesh [`#1340`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1340)
- Broken synced Layer support [`#1341`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1341)

## [1.8.0-rc.4] - 2024-11-06
### Fixed
- Animation bindings for BoxCollider generated by VRCStation will be removed [`#1331`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1331)
  - This might break the GogoLoco or other flying avatar that supports Quest / Android.

## [1.8.0-rc.3] - 2024-11-04
### Changed
- Improved performance in InternalAutoFreezeMeaninglessBlendShapeProcessor [`#1325`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1325)
- Performance improvements for AutoMergeBlendShape [`#1327`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1327)

### Fixed

## [1.8.0-rc.2] - 2024-11-03
### Fixed
- Animation broken with auto merge blendShape [`#1324`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1324)

## [1.8.0-rc.1] - 2024-11-03
### Added
- Automatically Merge Blendshape [`#1300`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1300)
  - This is new automatic optimization in Trace and Optimize
  - This is a part of "Optimize BlendShape" optimization.
  - AAO 1.8.0 introduced BlendShape support for Merge Skinned Mesh, but new default mode "Rename to avoid conflicts" would increase number of BlendShape.
  - This feature is added to relax this problem by automatically merging multiple BlendShapes of one Mesh.
  - With this feature, you can use rename mode without performance loss.
- Fix mode for PhysBone Limits in Merge PhysBone [`#665`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/665)
  - In addition to existing `Copy` and `Override`, we added `Fix` mode.
  - This mode will try to correct roll axis by rotating bone.
  - This feature allows you to configure the mode for PhysBone Limits in Merge PhysBone.
  - This is useful if all configuration is same but roll axis is different.
- Automatically merging meshes which have BlendShapes [`#1308`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1308)
  - In previous version of Avatar Optimizer, meshes which have BlendShapes are not automatically merged.
  - This was because BlendShape manipulation load is proportional to the number of vertices in Unity 2019.
  - However, in Unity 2020 and later, BlendShape manipulation load is mostly proportional to the number of moving vertices.
  - This means that increasing the number of vertices in a mesh which has BlendShapes does not increase the load of BlendShape manipulation much.
  - Therefore, we decided to automatically merge such meshes.
- Improved OSC Gimmick Support [`#1306`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1306)
  - We added two information for OSC Gimmick in Asset Description.
  - By defining parameters read / written by OSC Gimmick, your OSC Gimmick no longer breaks.

### Changed
- Show version name on NDMF Console [`#1309`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1309)

### Fixed
- NRE if specified expression parameters is None [`#1303`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1303)
  - This error only happens if you don't use Modular Avatar since Modular Avatar will assign parameters asset.
- "asset is not temporary asset" error if no Modular Avatar is used [`#1304`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1304)
- Merge Skinned Mesh with Basic Mesh is not working [`#1307`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1307)
- Validation system in Avatar Optimizer is not working [`#1307`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1307)

  - You now can successfully merge Meshes with BlendShape with Merge Skinned Mesh.
  - Actually, previous version does not have proper consideration for BlendShape.
  - This version introduces options to select BlendShape behavior in Merge Skinned Mesh.

### Changed
- More Preference Improvement [`#1288`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1288)

### Removed
- Merging BlendShape from Rename BlendShape component [`#1296`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1296)
  - We will add a new component for merging BlendShapes in the future.

### Fixed
- PrefabSafeUniqueCollection does not consider unity fake null [`#1294`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1294)
- BlendShape with same name is impclitly merged in Merge Skinned Mesh [`#1286`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1286)
  - Now you can rename BlendShape to avoid conflicts.

## [1.8.0-beta.9] - 2024-10-20

## [1.8.0-beta.7] - 2024-10-18
### Added
- Invert option for Remove Mesh in Box [`#1257`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1257)
  - You now can remove polygons outside of the box instead of inside the box.
  - Along with this new feature, we renamed `Remove Mesh in Box` to `Remove Mesh By Box` to make it more clear.
    - This doesn't change the class name of the component since it's already a part of the public API.
- Remove Mesh By UV Tile, a new way to remove polygons [`#1263`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1263)
  - You now easily remove some polygons of models configured for UV Tile Discard.
  - This component removes polygons like UV Tile Discard with Vertex Discard Mode.
- Texture Optimizer support for tiling UV [`#1268`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1268)
- API for AtlasTexture Compability [`#1269`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1269)
- Automatically remove unnecessary material properties based on shader [`#1041`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1041)
  - This feature is added to `Remove Unused Objects` in `Trace and Optimize`.
  - When you changed shader for an material, properties for previously used shaders might be remain
  - This may increase your avatar size by unexpectedly including unused textures
- Support for Shaders that depends on vertex index [`#1275`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1275)
  - Avatar Optimizer will not automatically merge meshes that are using vertex index
  - since merging them may change vertex order, which changes vertex index

### Changed
- Transform gizmo are now hidden while you're editing box of Remove Mesh in Box [`#1259`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1259)
  - This prevents mistakenly moving the Skinned Mesh Renderer while editing the box.
- Make MergePhysBone implement `INetworkID` [`#1260`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1260)
  - This allow you to configure networkid for merged PhysBone component
- Changed locale code for simplified chinese from `zh-cn` to `zh-hans` [`#1264`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1264)
  - This would improve compatibility with other NDMF tools.
  - Many NDMF tools uses `zh-hans` so previously you may see both 中文 (中国) and 中文 (简体).
  - I think zh-hans is more accurate expression so I changed so.

### Fixed
- `InvalidOperationException` with removing all polygon on one material slot [`#1255`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1255)
- Remove Mesh in Box does not work for meshes without Bones [`#1256`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1256)

- Renamed debug options internally [`#1228`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1228)
  - This will lose previously configured debug options.
  - However, debug options are not considered as Public API as stated in documents so this is not backward incompatible changes in semver 2.0.0 section 8.

### Fixed
- API about Prefab Safe Set are broken with prefab instance [`#1219`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1219)

### Added
- API to get in advance whether a polygon will be removed [`#1177`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1177)

### Changed
- Improved Prefab Safe Set, which are used in MergePhysBone, MergeSkinnedMesh, FreezeBlendShape and more components [`#1212`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1212)
  - This should improve compatibility with replacing base prefab, which is added in Unity 2022.
- Allow multiple component for Remove Mesh components with API [`#1216`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1216) [`#1218`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1218)
  - This allows non-destructive tools to add Remove Mesh components even if Remove Mesh component are added before.

### Fixed
- Typo in menu for creating Asset Description [`#1213`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1213)
- Optimize Texture broken with Crunch Compression [`#1215`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1215)

### Fixed
- Null Reference Exception with newly created VRCAnimatorPlayAudio [`#1199`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1199)
- Particle System that uses local scale will be broken [`#1197`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1197)
- Avatars with Visame Skinned Mesh disabled will not able to upload [`#1202`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1202)

## [1.8.0-beta.1] - 2024-09-20
### Added
- AnyState to Entry/Exit optimization in Optimize Animator [`#1157`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1157)
  - If AAO found animator layer only with AnyState, AAO tries to convert them to Entry / Exit pattern.
    - Currently due to implementation there are some patterns that can be convert but but not converted.
    - We may relax some restriction in the future.
  - Because we have to check for each condition if we use AnyState but we can check for only one (in best case) with entry/exit, this generally reduces cost for checking an parameter in a state.
  - Combined with Entry / Exit to 1D BlendTree optimization, which is implemented in previous release, your AnyState layer may be optimized to 1D BlendTree.
- Optimize Texture in Trace nad Optimize [`#1181`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1181) [`#1184`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1184)
  - Avatar Optimizer will pack texture and tries to reduce the VRAM usage.
  - Currently liltoon is only supported.
- `Copy Enablement Animation` to Merge Skinned Mesh [`#1173`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1173)
  - This feature copies activeness / enablement animation from merge target renderers to the merged renderer.
  - This feature is not enabled by default. You have to enable it in the inspector.
  - This feature supports copying activeness animation of `activeSelf` of the GameObjects or ancestors of the GameObjects.
    However, this feature does not work if multiple GameObjects (or both GameObject and Renderer itself) are animated.
  - In addition, this feature will be animate the `enabled` of the merged renderer, so you must not animate the `enabled` of the merged renderer.
    - If animations are unsupported, AAO will show an error message and abort the build.
- Support Read/Write disabled Meshes with Av3Emulator Enabled [`#1185`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1185)
  - Previously, AAO cannot process meshes with Read/Write disabled if AAO is triggered by Av3Emulator.
  - Since this release, AAO can process meshes with Read/Write disabled if AAO is triggered by Av3Emulator.
  - In addition, AAO now supports non-Float32 vertex buffers. 
    - We still use Float32 internally so Int32 data might lose precision a little.
    - However, AFAIK there is no real-world problem with this so we implemented this way.
    - If you found such a case, please report it.
  - This change make AAO incompatible with Unity without Graphics.
    - If you're building your avatar with batchmode with -nographics, please remove -nographics.
- Asset Description for Avatar Modify Support bundled in an avatar, Shinano [`#1189`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1189)

### Changed
- Skip Enablement Mismatched Renderers is now disabled by default [`#1169`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1169)
  - You still can enable it in the Inspector.
  - This change does not affect the behavior of previously added components.
- Use UInt16 index buffer if possible even when total vertex count is more than 2^16 [`#1178`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1178)
  - With baseVertex in index buffer, we can use UInt16 index buffer even if total vertex count is more than 2^16.
  - Of course, if one submeh references wide range of vertices, we cannot use UInt16 index buffer so we still use UInt32 index buffer in such a case.

### Removed
- Unity 2019 Support [`#1146`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1146)
  - For 2019 users, please use 1.7.x.

### Added
- Implement mask texture editor [`#1044`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1044)

### Changed
- Improved behavior with Read/Write Off [`#1045`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1045)
  - Because of Unity limitation, AAO cannot process meshes with R/W off on `Start` so it will be error.
  - However, on `Awake`, we can read them so AAO should process them.
  - Since this version, AAO will process meshes with R/W off on `Awake`.
  - This reduces the number of errors on the apply on play.
  - If you're using Av3Emulator, you still see the error.
  - In addition, in such case, we'll show `Auto Fix` button on the error message.
  - If you press the button, AAO will fix the error by changing the mesh to read/write enabled.
- `Advanced Options` section has benn renamed to `Debug Options` [`#1052`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1052)
  - This express the purpose of the section more clearly.
- Added `Advanced Optimizations` and moved `Remove Zero sized Polygons` to it [`#1052`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1052)
  - The `Remove Zero sized Polygons` can break some shaders or animations so it's not enabled by default.
  - To make it more clear, we moved it to `Advanced Optimizations`.

### Fixed
- Material Slot animations for multi-material multi-pass rendering are broken [`#1042`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1042)
  - Previously we only preserves animations for the number of submeshes instead of material slots.
- Relax Bounds condition for Automatic Merge Skinned Mesh [`#1043`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1043)
  - Previously, AAO doesn't merge Skinned Meshes if bounds are different accurately.
  - Since this version, AAO will merge meshes if bounds are the same with precision to the last 6 digits of decimal point.
- Entry/Exit to BlendTree broken with None state `1048`
- Particle System with bone-rigged Skinned Mesh Renderer will be broken [`#1054`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1054)

## [1.7.0] - 2024-04-30
## [1.7.0-rc.4] - 2024-04-26
### Changed
- Disabled AutoFreezeBlendShape for Skinned Mesh Renderers with Cloth component [`#1029`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1029)
  - According to the report, making some polygons zero-size by AutoFreezeBlendShape will make initializing avatar extremely heavy.
  - After a small discussion, we decided to not automatically optimize Skinned Mesh Renderers with Cloth component.

### Fixed
- Animating `m_Enabled` of Animator as a Behavior is broken [`#1028`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1028)
  - Since `Animator.property` become animating float animation property named `property`, 
  - AAO must keep it as `Behavior.m_Enabled` instead of `Animator.m_Enabled` but we were not.

## [1.7.0-rc.3] - 2024-04-24
## [1.7.0-rc.2] - 2024-04-24
### Changed
- It will be error if read/write mesh is off in play mode again [`#1018`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1018)
  - I found that we may not possible to read mesh with r/w mesh off mode in play mode with the Av3Emulator.

### Fixed
- Box Editor of Remove Mesh in Box can be broke with scale of Skinned Mesh Renderer [`#1019`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1019)
- Automatic Merge Skinned Mesh is broken with BlendTree [`#1020`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1020)
- Automatic Merge Skinned Mesh breaks mesh-shaped Particle System [`#1021`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1021)
  - In addition, reference to Skinned Meshes might be broken and this is also fixed.

## [1.7.0-rc.1] - 2024-04-19
## [1.7.0-beta.7] - 2024-04-16
### Fixed

### Added
- Animations animating missing GameObject is removed [`#994`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/994)
  - Since this update, animations that targeting GameObjects with post-AAO paths is no longer working.
  - Please create animations that targeting GameObjects with pre-AAO paths.
- Remove Mesh by Mask [`#998`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/998)
  - With this component, you can remove polygons with mask texture.
  - You can use use mask for [MeshDeleterWithTexture] or alpha mask to remove polygons.
- Remove Empty SubMesh in Trace and Optimize [`#1007`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1007)
  - This removes empty SubMeshes including becomes empty by optimization.

## [1.7.0-beta.1] - 2024-03-29
### Added
- Animator Optimizer [`#854`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/854)
  - Most features of Animator Optimizer is not available in Unity 2019.
  - Animator Optimizer optimizes your Animator Controller without behaviour Changes
  - Current Optimizer includes the following optimization
    - Remove meaningless properties [`#854`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/854)
    - Converts Entry / Exit to 1D BlendTree [`#854`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/854) [`#867`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/867) [`#927`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/927)
    - Merges multiple Direct BlendTree to single Direct BlendTree [`#870`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/870)
    - Removes meaningless Animator Layers [`#870`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/870)
- Asset Description [`#847`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/847)
  - Asset Description is the file to provide information of your assets for Avatar Optimizer.
  - Please see documentation for more details.
- Warning for material animation in Merge Skinned Mesh [`#769`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/769)
  - Merge Skinned Mesh does not support animating material properties differently. (In other words, it can be broken.)
  - Since this version, AAO will warn for such a case.
  - If you animated all materials from same animations, your animation will not be warned.
- API for declaring dependency relationship to the name of the component [`#943`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/943)
  - You can use this API to not change the name of the GameObject.
- Configuring `Clamp BlendShapes (Deprecated)` [`#957`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/957)
  - Since VRCSDK 3.5.1, VRCSDK sets `Clamp BlendShapes (Deprecated)` to true on assembly reload.
  - This is not a good setting for AAO in EditMode since AAO does not support clamping BlendShapes.
  - That's why AAO now configures `Clamp BlendShapes (Deprecated)` to false in edit mode and true in play mode.
  - PlayMode is usually used for testing the avatar behavior so it's better to have the same setting as VRChat client.
  - If you want not to change this setting, please disable `Tools/Avatar Optimizer/Configure Clamp BlendShape Weight`.
- Automatic Merge Skinned Mesh [`#952`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/952)
  - Trace and Optimize now automatically merges Skinned Meshes if possible.
  - Trace and Optimize will merge your mesh if the material properties or enablement of the mesh is animated similarly and has no BlendShapes.

### Changed
- MergePhysBone now corrects curve settings [`#775`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/775)
- MergePhysBone now warns if chain length are not same [`#775`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/775)
- MergePhysBone with only one source is now error [`#775`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/775)
  - It was not working well and not a error by a bug.
- Animator Parser is completely rewritten [`#850`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/850)
  - New Animator Parser allow us to track animating properties animated by components removed by AAO.
- PhysBone that swings no bones are now removed [`#864`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/864)
  - I found such a PhysBone on Lime so I added this feature.
- Switched Localization system to NDMF from CL4EE [`#873`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/873)
  - Since this release, Avatar Optimizer is no longer depends on CL4EE.
  - Because VCC doesn't remove unused packages, CL4EE may still be installed on your project.
  - If you want to remove CL4EE, please remove it manually.
- Suppressed animated BlendShape warning of FreezeBlendShape if it's animated to a few constants [`#881`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/881)
  - Modern models have tons of BlendShapes to change their face shape but emotion animation of some of them animates such a BlendShapes to constant (default value).
  - That's unnecessary (incorrect I think) and force users to remove or change the clip when user wants to face shape.
  - I see AAO users use `FreezeBlendShapes` for overriding such a BlendShapes on twitter.
  - I think using this way is reasonable enough so I suppressed the warning if AAO detected such a usage.
- Minimum VRCSDK to 3.3.0 [`#882`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/882)
  - VRCSDK 3.3.0 is required for stable NDMF-VRCSDK compatibility.
- Endpoint Position settings for newly created MergePhysBone is now Copy instead of Clear [`#945`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/945)
  - The Clear settings will increase the number of PhysBone Transforms so it's not better as a default settings.
- Improved activeness animation warning in Merge Skinned Mesh [`#948`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/948)
  - Reduced false-positive warnings
    - Previously, AAO warns if activeness warning is applied to different GameObjects.
    - However, this can be false-positive if animation is applied to different GameObjects with same timing.
    - Since this version, AAO will not warn if the activeness is animated in same animation clip with same curve.
  - Combined warning per Merge Skinned Mesh component.
    - Previously, AAO warns for each source Renderers.
    - Since this version, AAO creates one warning for each Merge Skinned Mesh component.
- Add error for Cloth component in Merge Skinned Mesh component [`#949`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/949)
  - The Cloth component is not supported by Merge Skinned Mesh component.
  - In previous versions, AAO will keep the source Skinned Mesh Renderer if it's with Cloth component by bug.
  - Since this version, AAO will make an error if the source Skinned Mesh Renderer is with Cloth component.
- Remove Unused Objects now removes PhysBones and Contact Receivers with parameters defined but not used by Animator Controllers [`#959`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/959)
  - Previously, AAO did not remove PhysBones and Contact Receivers if they are defined in Animator Controllers whether they are used or not.
  - I thought such a PhysBones on the base body are rare but my friend told me there is Manuka has such a PhysBone so I added this feature.
- Dropping GameObject to PrefabSafeSet adds the All components on the GameObject to the PrefabSafeSet [`#960`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/960)
  - You can add all PhysBones on the GameObject by dropping the GameObject to the MergePhysBone component.
- MergeSkinnedMesh now warns if Root Bone or Anchor Override are not set [`#963`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/963)

### Removed
- Compatibility with VRCQuestTools v1.x [`#847`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/847)
  - Please use VRCQuestTools v2.x, which has compatibility with AAO.

### Fixed
- Inspector of ComponentTypePair (GCDebug) is broken [`#846`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/846)
- Bones swung by unused PhysBones (which will be removed by AAO) are not merged [`#850`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/850)
  - Note that To fix this problem, AnimatorParser is almost completely rewritten.
  - It's not expected to have behavior change, but if you found some, please report it.
- Re-fix Nested Constraint can be broken with Trace and Optimize [`#880`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/880)
