# Documentation site

Documentation site for AvatarOptimizer is created using [hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

## Localization Rules

1. Anchor names must match as original page. you can change anchor name using `{#installation}`
2. If you want to add new language for AvatarOptimizer, be a maintainer for that locale.
   This means you must update docs for that locale as soon and long as possible.

## Other informations

- Screenshots of the components are taken using EditorScreenshotTakeTool with width `320`
- Screenshots in tutorial are taken with Anon.unity. The Anon.unity is made with [Anon] 1.06

## Internals doc

In addition to the documentation site, there is also an documentation for internal use tools in Avatar Optimizer in the `internals` folder.
Those can be used to understand how the tools for debugging the Avatar Optimizer works.
Those may not be up to date, but I hope it helps you to understand.
