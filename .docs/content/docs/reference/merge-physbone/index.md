# Merge PhysBone (MergePB) {#merge-physbone}

This component merges multiple PhysBone Components into one Component with MultiChildType == Ignore.

This component should be added to a new GameObject.

## Notes

Merge target PhysBones must be children of the same GameObject.
Alternatively, you can use `Make Children of Me` option.

This component will create a new PhysBone root GameObject and make the bones swayed by merge target PhysBones into children of this GameObject.\
Since the root GameObject is treated as a PhysBone affected Transforms, the number of `PhysBone Affected Transforms` will be increased by one for each Merge PhysBone.
The GameObject added by this component will not be swayed by PhysBone, so this can be a bug of the VRChat Performance Rank System.
