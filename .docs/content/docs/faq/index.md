# Frequently Asked Questions {#faq}

Here is the list of frequently asked questions about Avatar Optimizer.
If you have some other questions, please feel free to ask on the [GitHub Discussions], [NDMF Discord] or [Fediverse (Misskey / Mastodon)][Fediverse].
I'm usually use Japanese, but you can ask me with English.

## The behavior or appearance of the avatar is changed when using `AAO Trace and Optimize` component {#avatar-behavior-or-appearance-changed-when-using-aao-trace-and-optimize-component}

If the behavior or appearance of the avatar is changed when using `AAO Trace and Optimize` component, it is always a bug unless you depend on bugs in other components of Avatar Optimizer.

Please report it on [GitHub Issues], [Fediverse (Misskey / Mastodon)][Fediverse], [Twitter], etc.

## Mesh is invisible even though it is in the field of view {#mesh-is-invisible-even-though-it-is-in-the-field-of-view}

This problem is often due to forgetting to specify the `Root Bone` of the Skinned Mesh Renderer.

[`AAO Merge Skinned Mesh`] component does not automatically set the `Root Bone`, so you need to manually set the `Root Bone` of the Merged Mesh[^merged-mesh].

If you are using [Modular Avatar], you can add [`MA Mesh Settings`] component to the root of the avatar to set the `Root Bone` and `Bounds` for the whole avatar.

## The brightness of the meshes merged with `AAO Merge Skinned Mesh` component is different from other meshes {#the-brightness-of-the-meshes-merged-with-aao-merge-skinned-mesh-component-is-different-from-other-meshes}

This problem is often due to forgetting to specify the `Anchor Override` of the merged meshes.\
[`AAO Merge Skinned Mesh`] component does not automatically set the `Anchor Override`, so you need to manually set the `Anchor Override` of the Merged Mesh[^merged-mesh].

If you are using [Modular Avatar], you can add [`MA Mesh Settings`] component to the root of the avatar to set the `Anchor Override` for the whole avatar.

## Material property animations conflict when using `AAO Merge Skinned Mesh` component {#material-property-animations-conflict-when-using-aao-merge-skinned-mesh-component}

This problem is a known bug and is currently expected to conflicts.

When merging meshes with animated material propeeries, be careful not to conflict.
If there is a conflict, a warning will be displayed, so please check the warning.

Issue of this problem: [#340](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/issues/340)

## Material slot animations conflict when using `AAO Merge Skinned Mesh` component {#material-slot-animations-conflict-when-using-aao-merge-skinned-mesh-component}

`AAO Merge Skinned Mesh` component will merge material slots using the same material of the merge target meshes by default.
This will also merge animated material slots.

If you have some material slots which will be replaced differently with animation, you should un-check `Merge` of `Merge Materials` of `AAO Merge Skinned Mesh` component.

## BlendShape animations conflict when using `AAO Merge Skinned Mesh` component {#blendshape-animations-conflict-when-using-aao-merge-skinned-mesh-component}

This problem is a known bug and is currently expected to conflicts.

When merging meshes with animated BlendShapes, be careful not to conflict.
If there is a conflict, a warning will be displayed, so please check the warning.

Issue of this problem: [#568](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/issues/568)

## PhysBones / Contact Receivers that are used in the OSC-based gimmick are not working {#physbones-contact-receivers-that-are-used-in-the-osc-based-gimmick-are-not-working}

The `AAO Trace and Optimize` component is carefully designed to not change the behavior of the avatar.
However, for technical reasons, the `AAO Trace and Optimize` component cannot detect some PhysBone / Contact Receiver components are used in the OSC-based gimmick or not.

Some modern avatars have their own gimmicks based on PhysBone / Contact Receiver components, so those components will be forgotten to remove in most cases.
Therefore, `AAO Trace and Optimize` will assume that such components are not for OSC-based gimmick, and remove them if they are not used for other ways.

This assumption is not always the case, so if you are using PhysBone / Contact Receiver components for the OSC-based gimmick without Animator or Expressions,
please create [Asset Description] and please configure [Parameters Read By External Tools] for your OSC-based gimmick.

If the gimmick is published or selling, I would like to bundle your Asset Description with AAO to improve compatibility with the gimmick.
If you would like to, please contact us on [GitHub], [NDMF Discord], [Fediverse (Misskey / Mastodon)][Fediverse], or [Twitter].

## I cannot upload the avatar because of pre-build hard limit check {#i-cannot-upload-the-avatar-because-of-pre-build-hard-limit-check}

This is because the upload button on the VRCSDK Control Panel is disabled if the hard limit is exceeded with on-scene Avatar.

However, since VRChat SDK 3.8.1, VRCSDK allows you to start building and uploading the avatar even if the hard limit is exceeded with on-scene Avatar.
Therefore, the recommended way to fix this problem is to update the VRCSDK to the latest version.

When you have some problems with upgrading the VRCSDK, you may use some external tools that can initiate the upload process without using the VRCSDK Control Panel.

## I want to support the development of Avatar Optimizer {#i-want-to-support-the-development-of-avatar-optimizer}

If you want to support the development of Avatar Optimizer, feedback on [GitHub Discussions], bug reports, feature requests, etc. on [GitHub Issues], and pull requests are welcome.

Issues with [good first issue] are relatively easy to implement. It is recommended for your first pull request.
Also, issues with [help wanted] are ones that lack developers or information. Your participation in discussions and development would be appreciated.

I also accept financial support on [GitHub Sponsors] and [Booth].
