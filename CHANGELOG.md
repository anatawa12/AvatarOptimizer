  - [This Canny](https://feedback.vrchat.com/bug-reports/p/physbone-freezes-if-parents-scale-is-zero-on-enable-then-become-non-zero-and-isa) is about this issue.

## [1.8.9] - 2025-04-11
### Added
- Support for liltoon 1.9.0 [`#1436`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1436)

## [1.8.8] - 2025-04-04
### Changed
- Declare compatibility with VRCSDK 3.8.x [`#1432`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1432)
  - No beta sdk for 3.8.0 (it was 3.7.x) so this is not possible before stable release.

### Fixed
- Particle Systems referencing Skinned Mesh Renderers without material slots will be broken [`#1426`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1426)
  - AAO's removing unused submeshes feature will remove all submeshes if there are no material slots.
  - However, Unity's Particle System does't require materials slots are present so AAO broke this relatively rare case.
- Optimize Texture is not applied in some cases [`#1427`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1427)

## [1.8.7] - 2025-03-01
### Added
- Context menu to add Trace And Optimize [`#1411`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1411)
- Undocumented trace level debug log [`#1414`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1414)

### Changed
- Removed missing viseme / eyelids warning [`#1401`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1401)
- Improved Optimize Texture a little [`#1404`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1404)
  - This should reduce texture memory usage a little and fixes a bug that may increase texture usage.

### Fixed
- Animations targets GameObjects includes '/' in their name can be broken [`#1399`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1399)
- Animation Clips can be broken if timeline window is open [`#1417`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1417)

## [1.8.6] - 2025-02-14
### Fixed
- Error when we manually configure Merge Skinned Mesh for face mesh along with Trace and Optimize [`#1396`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1396)
- Missing localization for copy enablement animation related errors [`#1397`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1397)

## [1.8.5] - 2025-02-05
### Fixed
- Component Validation Errors doesn't have error source component information [`#1390`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1390)
- liltoon Angel Ring MatCap settings broken [`#1391`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1391)

## [1.8.4] - 2025-01-19
### Fixed
- Performance improvements [`#1380`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1380)
- Meshes merged by AutoMergeSkinnedMesh might be incorrectly removed [`#1381`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1381)
- VRM: Fix BlendShape mapping [`#1375`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1375)
- VRM: Fix Trace and Optimize incorrectly merging Skinned Meshes with different FirstPerson settings  [`#1376`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1376)

## [1.8.3] - 2024-12-24
### Fixed
- Prefab overrides on the scene are reverted on first load of the scene at first launch [`#1372`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1372)
- Animating transform with C# named properties are broken by merge bone [`#1373`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1373)
  - Animator window won't create such animation but some script generates and it works surprisingly
- Errors with blendShapes with exactly same name in a mesh [`#1374`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1374)
  - Such mesh can be generated with Autodesk Maya or 3ds Max
  - Unity API denies generating such mesh with C# so AAO will rename such blendShapes to unique name to support.
  - Unity Animator does animate first blendshale only so second shape would generally removed by remove unused blendShapes.

## [1.8.2] - 2024-12-11
### Added
- `-` button for prefab safe set [`#1368`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1368)

### Fixed
- Errors with models with UV at very edge [`#1363`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1363)
- Errors if exactly same AnimatorController is specified for multiple playable layers [`#1366`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1366)
- Errors if objects removed by some component is listed on exclusions of Trace and Optimize [`#1367`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1367)
- OverflowException when creating prefab [`#1369`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1369)

## [1.8.1] - 2024-12-01
### Fixed
- Optimize Texture may break liltoon outline mask [`#1357`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1357)

## [1.8.0] - 2024-11-30
### Added
- AnyState to Entry/Exit optimization in Optimize Animator [`#1157`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1157)
  - If AAO found animator layer only with AnyState, AAO tries to convert them to Entry / Exit pattern.
    - Currently due to implementation there are some patterns that can be convert but but not converted.
    - We may relax some restriction in the future.
  - Because we have to check for each condition if we use AnyState but we can check for only one (in best case) with entry/exit, this generally reduces cost for checking an parameter in a state.
  - Combined with Entry / Exit to 1D BlendTree optimization, which is implemented in previous release, your AnyState layer may be optimized to 1D BlendTree.
- Optimize Texture in Trace nad Optimize [`#1181`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1181) [`#1184`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1184) [`#1193`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1193) [`#1215`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1215) [`#1225`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1225) [`#1235`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1235) [`#1268`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1268) [`#1278`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1278) [`#1313`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1313) [`#1328`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1328) [`#1338`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1338) [`#1334`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1334) [`#1346`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1346)
  - Avatar Optimizer will pack texture and tries to reduce the VRAM usage.
  - Currently liltoon is only supported.
- `Copy Enablement Animation` to Merge Skinned Mesh [`#1173`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1173)
  - This feature copies activeness / enablement animation from merge target renderers to the merged renderer.
  - This feature is not enabled by default. You have to enable it in the inspector.
  - This feature supports copying activeness animation of `activeSelf` of the GameObjects or ancestors of the GameObjects.
    However, this feature does not work if multiple GameObjects (or both GameObject and Renderer itself) are animated.
  - In addition, this feature will be animate the `enabled` of the merged renderer, so you must not animate the `enabled` of the merged renderer.
    - If animations are unsupported, AAO will show an error message and abort the build.
- Support Read/Write disabled Meshes with Av3Emulator Enabled [`#1185`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1185)
  - Previously, AAO cannot process meshes with Read/Write disabled if AAO is triggered by Av3Emulator.
  - Since this release, AAO can process meshes with Read/Write disabled if AAO is triggered by Av3Emulator.
  - In addition, AAO now supports non-Float32 vertex buffers.
    - We still use Float32 internally so Int32 data might lose precision a little.
    - However, AFAIK there is no real-world problem with this so we implemented this way.
    - If you found such a case, please report it.
  - This change make AAO incompatible with Unity without Graphics.
    - If you're building your avatar with batchmode with -nographics, please remove -nographics.
- Asset Description for Avatar Modify Support bundled in an avatar, Shinano [`#1189`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1189)
- API to get in advance whether a polygon will be removed [`#1177`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1177)
- Rename BlendShape component to rename BlendShapes [`#1245`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1245) [`#1296`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1296)
  - This can be used to avoid blendShape name conflicts in Merge Skinned Mesh
- Invert option for Remove Mesh in Box [`#1257`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1257)
  - You now can remove polygons outside of the box instead of inside the box.
  - Along with this new feature, we renamed `Remove Mesh in Box` to `Remove Mesh By Box` to make it more clear.
    - This doesn't change the class name of the component since it's already a part of the public API.
- Remove Mesh By UV Tile, a new way to remove polygons [`#1263`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1263)
  - You now easily remove some polygons of models configured for UV Tile Discard.
  - This component removes polygons like UV Tile Discard with Vertex Discard Mode.
- Automatically remove unnecessary material properties based on shader [`#1041`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1041)
  - This feature is added to `Remove Unused Objects` in `Trace and Optimize`.
  - When you changed shader for an material, properties for previously used shaders might be remain
  - This may increase your avatar size by unexpectedly including unused textures
- Right-click menu option to create a new GameObject with a specified component [`#1290`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1290)
- Automatically Merge Blendshape [`#1300`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1300) [`#1324`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1324)
  - This is new automatic optimization in Trace and Optimize
  - This is a part of "Optimize BlendShape" optimization.
  - AAO 1.8.0 introduced BlendShape support for Merge Skinned Mesh, but new default mode "Rename to avoid conflicts" would increase number of BlendShape.
  - This feature is added to relax this problem by automatically merging multiple BlendShapes of one Mesh.
  - With this feature, you can use rename mode without performance loss.
- Fix mode for PhysBone Limits in Merge PhysBone [`#665`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/665) [`#1336`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1336) [`#1345`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1345)
  - In addition to existing `Copy` and `Override`, we added `Fix` mode.
  - This mode will try to correct roll axis by rotating bone.
  - This feature allows you to configure the mode for PhysBone Limits in Merge PhysBone.
  - This is useful if all configuration is same but roll axis is different.
- Automatically merging meshes which have BlendShapes [`#1308`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1308)
  - In previous version of Avatar Optimizer, meshes which have BlendShapes are not automatically merged.
  - This was because BlendShape manipulation load is proportional to the number of vertices in Unity 2019.
  - However, in Unity 2020 and later, BlendShape manipulation load is mostly proportional to the number of moving vertices.
  - This means that increasing the number of vertices in a mesh which has BlendShapes does not increase the load of BlendShape manipulation much.
  - Therefore, we decided to automatically merge such meshes.
- Improved OSC Gimmick Support [`#1306`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1306) [`#1351`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1351)
  - We added two information for OSC Gimmick in Asset Description.
  - By defining parameters read / written by OSC Gimmick, your OSC Gimmick no longer breaks.
- Automatically Merge Material Slot [`#1334`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1334)
  - If you have multile material slots with same material, it will be merged automatically.

### Changed
- Skip Enablement Mismatched Renderers is now disabled by default [`#1169`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1169)
  - You still can enable it in the Inspector.
  - This change does not affect the behavior of previously added components.
- Use UInt16 index buffer if possible even when total vertex count is more than 2^16 [`#1178`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1178) [`#1255`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1255)
  - With baseVertex in index buffer, we can use UInt16 index buffer even if total vertex count is more than 2^16.
  - Of course, if one submeh references wide range of vertices, we cannot use UInt16 index buffer so we still use UInt32 index buffer in such a case.
- Reimplement Preview system with NDMF Preview System [`#1131`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1131) [`#1195`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1195) [`#1218`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1218) [`#1270`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1270)
  - This will prevent issues relates to Animation Mode bug.
  - This allows you to preview Remove Mesh components without selecting Mesh OR while in Animation Mode.
- Improved Prefab Safe Set, which are used in MergePhysBone, MergeSkinnedMesh, FreezeBlendShape and more components [`#1212`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1212) [`#1219`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1219) [`#1221`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1221) [`#1236`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1236) [`#1287`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1287) [`#1294`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1294) [`#1348`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1348)
  - This should improve compatibility with replacing base prefab, which is added in Unity 2022.
- Allow multiple component for Remove Mesh components with API [`#1216`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1216) [`#1218`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1218)
  - This allows non-destructive tools to add Remove Mesh components even if Remove Mesh component are added before.
- Animator Parser Debug Window now supports ObjectReference animation support [`#1222`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1222)
- Reimplemented Animator Parser node system [`#1227`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1227)
- Renamed debug options internally [`#1228`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1228)
  - This will lose previously configured debug options.
  - However, debug options are not considered as Public API as stated in documents so this is not backward incompatible changes in semver 2.0.0 section 8.
- Performance Improvements [`#1234`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1234) [`#1243`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1243) [`#1240`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1240) [`#1288`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1288) [`#1304`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1304) [`#1307`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1307) [`#1314`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1314) [`#1325`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1325) [`#1327`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1327) [`#1326`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1326) [`#1341`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1341)
- Transform gizmo are now hidden while you're editing box of Remove Mesh in Box [`#1259`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1259)
  - This prevents mistakenly moving the Skinned Mesh Renderer while editing the box.
- Make MergePhysBone implement `INetworkID` [`#1260`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1260)
  - This allow you to configure networkid for merged PhysBone component
- Changed locale code for simplified chinese from `zh-cn` to `zh-hans` [`#1264`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1264)
  - This would improve compatibility with other NDMF tools.
  - Many NDMF tools uses `zh-hans` so previously you may see both 中文 (中国) and 中文 (简体).
  - I think zh-hans is more accurate expression so I changed so.
- Improve RemoveMeshByMask compability with Tex Trans Tool [`#1269`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1269)
- Support for Shaders that depends on vertex index [`#1275`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1275) [`#1281`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1281) [`#1285`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1285)
  - Avatar Optimizer will not automatically merge meshes that are using vertex index
  - since merging them may change vertex order, which changes vertex index
- BlendShape support for Merge Skinned Mesh [`#1286`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1286) [`#1299`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1299)
  - You now can successfully merge Meshes with BlendShape with Merge Skinned Mesh.
  - Actually, previous version does not have proper consideration for BlendShape.
  - This version introduces options to select BlendShape behavior in Merge Skinned Mesh.
- Renamed "Automatically Freeze BlendShape" to "Optimize BlendShape" [`#1300`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1300)

### Removed

- NullReferenceException in `GetBlendShape` if Mesh is not specified for SkinnedMeshRenderer [`#1267`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1267)
- Animation for target renderer of Merge Skinned Mesh might be overridden by animation for source renderer [`#1276`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1276)
- BlendShape with same name is impclitly merged in Merge Skinned Mesh [`#1286`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1286)
  - Now you can rename BlendShape to avoid conflicts.
- NRE if specified expression parameters is None [`#1303`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1303)
  - This error only happens if you don't use Modular Avatar since Modular Avatar will assign parameters asset.

- An error with MergePhysBone [`#1061`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1061)
- Animators depends on the WD=off behavior can be broken [`#1062`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1062)

## [1.7.1] - 2024-05-07
### Added
- Implement mask texture editor [`#1044`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1044)
- Add Simplified Chinese translation [`#1055`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1045)

### Changed
- Improved behavior with Read/Write Off [`#1045`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1045)
  - Because of Unity limitation, AAO cannot process meshes with R/W off on `Start` so it will be error.
  - However, on `Awake`, we can read them so AAO should process them.
  - Since this version, AAO will process meshes with R/W off on `Awake`.
  - This reduces the number of errors on the apply on play.
  - If you're using Av3Emulator, you still see the error.
  - In addition, in such case, we'll show `Auto Fix` button on the error message.
  - If you press the button, AAO will fix the error by changing the mesh to read/write enabled.
- `Advanced Options` section has benn renamed to `Debug Options` [`#1052`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1052)
  - This express the purpose of the section more clearly.
- Added `Advanced Optimizations` and moved `Remove Zero sized Polygons` to it [`#1052`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1052)
  - The `Remove Zero sized Polygons` can break some shaders or animations so it's not enabled by default.
  - To make it more clear, we moved it to `Advanced Optimizations`.

### Fixed
- Material Slot animations for multi-material multi-pass rendering are broken [`#1042`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1042)
  - Previously we only preserves animations for the number of submeshes instead of material slots.
- Relax Bounds condition for Automatic Merge Skinned Mesh [`#1043`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1043)
  - Previously, AAO doesn't merge Skinned Meshes if bounds are different accurately.
  - Since this version, AAO will merge meshes if bounds are the same with precision to the last 6 digits of decimal point.
- Entry/Exit to BlendTree broken with None state `1048`
- Particle System with bone-rigged Skinned Mesh Renderer will be broken [`#1054`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1054)

## [1.7.0] - 2024-04-30
### Added
- Animator Optimizer [`#854`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/854)
  - Most features of Animator Optimizer is not available in Unity 2019.
  - Animator Optimizer optimizes your Animator Controller without behaviour Changes
  - Current Optimizer includes the following optimization
    - Remove meaningless properties [`#854`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/854)
    - Converts Entry / Exit to 1D BlendTree [`#854`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/854) [`#867`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/867) [`#927`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/927) [`#970`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/970) [`#982`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/982) [`#991`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/991)
    - Merges multiple BlendTrees to single Direct BlendTree [`#870`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/870) [`#978`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/978) [`#980`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/980) [`#984`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/984)
    - Removes meaningless Animator Layers [`#870`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/870)
- Asset Description [`#847`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/847)
  - Asset Description is the file to provide information of your assets for Avatar Optimizer.
  - Please see documentation for more details.
- Warning for material animation in Merge Skinned Mesh [`#769`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/769)
  - Merge Skinned Mesh does not support animating material properties differently. (In other words, it can be broken.)
  - Since this version, AAO will warn for such a case.
  - If you animated all materials from same animations, your animation will not be warned.
- API for declaring dependency relationship to the name of the component [`#943`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/943)
  - You can use this API to not change the name of the GameObject.
- Configuring `Clamp BlendShapes (Deprecated)` [`#957`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/957)
  - Since VRCSDK 3.5.1, VRCSDK sets `Clamp BlendShapes (Deprecated)` to true on assembly reload.
  - This is not a good setting for AAO in EditMode since AAO does not support clamping BlendShapes.
  - That's why AAO now configures `Clamp BlendShapes (Deprecated)` to false in edit mode and true in play mode.
  - PlayMode is usually used for testing the avatar behavior so it's better to have the same setting as VRChat client.
  - If you want not to change this setting, please disable `Tools/Avatar Optimizer/Configure Clamp BlendShape Weight`.
- Automatic Merge Skinned Mesh [`#952`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/952) [`#972`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/972) [`#1010`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1010) [`#1020`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1020) [`#1021`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1021)
  - Trace and Optimize now automatically merges Skinned Meshes if possible.
  - Trace and Optimize will merge your mesh if the material properties or enablement of the mesh is animated similarly and has no BlendShapes.
- Components API for Scripting Usage [`#976`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/976)
  - You can now add AAO components from your script.
- Animations animating missing GameObject is removed [`#994`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/994)
  - Since this update, animations that targeting GameObjects with post-AAO paths is no longer working.
  - Please create animations that targeting GameObjects with pre-AAO paths.
- Remove Mesh by Mask [`#998`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/998)
  - With this component, you can remove polygons with mask texture.
  - You can use use mask for [MeshDeleterWithTexture] or alpha mask to remove polygons.
- Remove Empty SubMesh in Trace and Optimize [`#1007`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1007)
  - This removes empty SubMeshes including becomes empty by optimization.

[MeshDeleterWithTexture]: https://github.com/gatosyocora/MeshDeleterWithTexture

### Changed
- MergePhysBone now corrects curve settings [`#775`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/775)
- MergePhysBone now warns if chain length are not same [`#775`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/775)
- MergePhysBone with only one source is now error [`#775`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/775)
  - It was not working well and not a error by a bug.
- Animator Parser is completely rewritten [`#850`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/850) [`#968`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/968) [`#1011`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1011)
  - New Animator Parser allow us to track animating properties animated by components removed by AAO.
- PhysBone that swings no bones are now removed [`#864`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/864)
  - I found such a PhysBone on Lime so I added this feature.
- Switched Localization system to NDMF from CL4EE [`#873`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/873)
  - Since this release, Avatar Optimizer is no longer depends on CL4EE.
  - Because VCC doesn't remove unused packages, CL4EE may still be installed on your project.
  - If you want to remove CL4EE, please remove it manually.
- Suppressed animated BlendShape warning of FreezeBlendShape if it's animated to a few constants [`#881`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/881)
  - Modern models have tons of BlendShapes to change their face shape but emotion animation of some of them animates such a BlendShapes to constant (default value).
  - That's unnecessary (incorrect I think) and force users to remove or change the clip when user wants to face shape.
  - I see AAO users use `FreezeBlendShapes` for overriding such a BlendShapes on twitter.
  - I think using this way is reasonable enough so I suppressed the warning if AAO detected such a usage.
- Changed minimum VRCSDK to 3.3.0 [`#882`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/882)
  - VRCSDK 3.3.0 is required for stable NDMF-VRCSDK compatibility.
- Endpoint Position settings for newly created MergePhysBone is now Copy instead of Clear [`#945`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/945)
  - The Clear settings will increase the number of PhysBone Transforms so it's not better as a default settings.
- Improved activeness animation warning in Merge Skinned Mesh [`#948`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/948)
  - Reduced false-positive warnings
    - Previously, AAO warns if activeness warning is applied to different GameObjects.
    - However, this can be false-positive if animation is applied to different GameObjects with same timing. 
    - Since this version, AAO will not warn if the activeness is animated in same animation clip with same curve.
  - Combined warning per Merge Skinned Mesh component.
    - Previously, AAO warns for each source Renderers.
    - Since this version, AAO creates one warning for each Merge Skinned Mesh component.
- Add error for Cloth component in Merge Skinned Mesh component [`#949`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/949)
  - The Cloth component is not supported by Merge Skinned Mesh component.
  - In previous versions, AAO will keep the source Skinned Mesh Renderer if it's with Cloth component by bug.
  - Since this version, AAO will make an error if the source Skinned Mesh Renderer is with Cloth component.
- Remove Unused Objects now removes PhysBones and Contact Receivers with parameters defined but not used by Animator Controllers [`#959`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/959)
  - Previously, AAO did not remove PhysBones and Contact Receivers if they are defined in Animator Controllers whether they are used or not.
  - I thought such a PhysBones on the base body are rare but my friend told me there is Manuka has such a PhysBone so I added this feature.
- Dropping GameObject to PrefabSafeSet adds the All components on the GameObject to the PrefabSafeSet [`#960`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/960)
  - You can add all PhysBones on the GameObject by dropping the GameObject to the MergePhysBone component.
- MergeSkinnedMesh now warns if Root Bone or Anchor Override are not set [`#963`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/963)
- It will be error if read/write mesh is off in play mode again [`#1018`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1018)
  - I found that we may not possible to read mesh with r/w mesh off mode in play mode with the Av3Emulator.
- Disabled AutoFreezeBlendShape for Skinned Mesh Renderers with Cloth component [`#1029`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/1029)
  - According to the report, making some polygons zero-size by AutoFreezeBlendShape will make initializing avatar extremely heavy.
  - After a small discussion, we decided to not automatically optimize Skinned Mesh Renderers with Cloth component.

### Removed
- Compatibility with VRCQuestTools v1.x [`#847`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/847)
  - Please use VRCQuestTools v2.x, which has compatibility with AAO.

### Fixed
- Inspector of ComponentTypePair (GCDebug) is broken [`#846`](https://github.com/anatawa12/AvatarOptimizer/pull/846)
